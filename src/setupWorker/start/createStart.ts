The mocking is still enabled, but it's highly recommended that you update your Service Worker by running:

$ npx msw init <PUBLIC_DIR>

This is necessary to ensure that the Service Worker is in sync with the library to guarantee its stability.
If this message still persists after updating, please report an issue: https://github.com/open-draft/msw/issues\
